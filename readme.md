# HELLO PROFESSOR!!
IN THIS ASSIGNMENT, THERE ARE 3 LEVELS OF A CALCULATOR. <br/>

# HOMEWORK3 3:

For the HOMEWORK 3, I have worked with 3 branches i.e Master, Level2 and Level3. <br/>
These are the three levels of calculator where it starts from Basic calculations to advanced calculations.  

##Commands:

pytest<br/>
pytest --pylint<br/>
pytest --pylint --cov<br/>

# HOMEWORK4 4:
For HOMEWORK 4, I have worked with the same github repo as HOMEWORK3 as HOMEWORK4 is the continuation of HOMEWORK3. <br/>
In HOMEWORK4 I have created two more branches for faker, test data generation and command line. <br/>
After successful working of those two branches, I have merged them into the master branch.
